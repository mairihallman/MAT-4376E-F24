## Task

Data Visualization
In this project, you will produce data visualizations for the following dataset.
Datasets: polls_us_election_2016.csv
Tasks:
1. Create a data dictionary for this dataset. Establish a list of variables that you think are crucial to a good understanding of the dataset. Justify your choices.
1. Create (at least) 5 bivariate/univariate visualizations that can help you understand the dataset.
2. Produce (at least) 3 “definitive” visualizations for the dataset. Use the principles discussed in class (including documentation, legends, annotations, etc.). Emphasis should be placed on content AND on presentation.
Hints/Suggestions:
- Use ggplot2/seaborne and editing tools, as needed/required.
- Consider creating a reasonably high number of charts using a random selection of a random number of variables in order to minimize the odds of missing out on useful information.
- Remember the “Multiple I” framework.
