[FiveThirtyEight polling average methodology]https://fivethirtyeight.com/methodology/how-our-polling-averages-work/] - guideline for us?

- polls of likely voters > polls of registered voters > polls of all adults
- cap sample sizes at 5000, windsorize (idk if windsorizing makes sense here)
- if sample size isn't reported, use median sample size of polls from that polster of that type (if no other info, use median sample size of all other polls of that type) - note type doesn't matter for us
- for overlapping polls from a given firm -  dynamically remove polls with overlapping dates until greatest number of polls with no overlapping dates is retained (no)
- sample size weighting - square root of poll's sample size / square root for median sample size for group
