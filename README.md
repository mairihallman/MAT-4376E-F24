## Data Analytics with Python (if we decide to go with it)

- There are a number of pre-made packages to make out lives easier
- You may be familiar with the idea of an array l = [1,2,3,4]
- This is a common data type in programming
- At their core, each of the packages give us a *fancy* array type that give us more tools.
- Ex.
    - Pandas (https://pandas.pydata.org/getting_started.html)
    - the array takes the form of a Dataframe
    - once a Dataframe has been created we have a new set of tools to operate on it

```python
In [1]: import pandas as pd

In [2]: pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, 3]})
Out[2]: 
   A
0  1
1  2
2  3
```
- Cont.
    - these tools are used by thousands of data analyticians(?), theres lot of tools built in :)
- Ex.
    - Numpy (https://numpy.org)
    - while Pandas is more for general data modification, Numpy (num-py) provides more tools for scientist
    - In numpy we have the idea of a numpy array, rather than the dataframe above
    - This numpy array has tools associated with it... but not many
```
Note : Different libraries will not (generally) work together perfectly well, if you have say, a Pandas Dataframe.
If you would like to use a function provided by Numpy, you need to turn the array from a Dataframe -> Numpy array. There are built in functions for this. 
```
```python
df = pd.DataFrame({"A": [1, 2], "B": [3.0, 4.5]})
df.to_numpy()
array([[1. , 3. ],
       [2. , 4.5]])
```
- Cont.
    - Why use numpy then?
    - Numpy arrays are a standard in python, a number of other packages use them as opposed to Pythons built in arrays. They tend to be more efficient computationally. 
    - One such example is Tensorflow (forshadowing is a literary device used to...)
- Ex.
    - Tensorflow (https://www.tensorflow.org)
    - Tensorflow is (one of) THE machine learning packages for python!
    - You want regression, neural networks, support vector machines, clustering, they're all here
    - Tensorflow uses (among other) numpy arrays as an input for data. 

- Jupyter Notebook
    - This is a tool used to make running code easier. Please see example.ipynb for an example
    - NOTE: the file extension is .ipynb NOT .py
    - Jupyter Notebook allows you to run code in chunks at a time, rather than running the entire page over and over again.

- Anaconda (or mini-conda)
    - You may feel now that there are too many packages to keep track of, and if you don't yet, don't worry, there are a lot more I haven't talked about yet.
    - bUt zAcH, HoW dO wE KeEp tRaCk oF aLl oF ThEse..
    - Anaconda is called an Environment management tool
    - it makes sure across all of our computers we all have the same packages that are needed for the entire project
    - in OUR case it will make sure we're all working on the same thing
    - Github is for files, Anaconda is for Python stuff
    - Why did I say (or mini-conda)? Anaconda is a biiiig boi. Arguably too much for what we need. Hence, the developers made Mini-conda, yes it has less tools, but it's all the ones we will need. Download whichever you'd like, just bare in mind the last time I check Anaconda was like 20gb

I will link below a few YouTube videos that provide a very good introduction to data science with Python below.
